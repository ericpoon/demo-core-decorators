# Core Decorators in JavaScript

This project is inspired by [core-decorators](https://github.com/jayphelps/core-decorators).

Implemented for fun and learning purpose only.

## Decorators

##### For Properties
* @readonly
* @lazyinit

##### For Methods
* @log
* @timer
* @memoize
* @decorate
* @before
* @afterReturning
* @afterThrowing
* @afterFinally
* @around

> Note: _@before_, _@after*_ and _@around_ decorators are inspired by Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) pattern in Java

> Note: Unit tests are available for all decorators, and integration tests with [lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) are available for _@decorate_
